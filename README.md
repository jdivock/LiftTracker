# LiftTracker

Right, simple lift logging app for my own use. Taken many swings at
this over time, usually with a mobile page but we both know that ain't
cutting it. So here we go, the initial idea is pretty simple. Just
some inputs or maybe build a dynamic select box to choose lifts from.
Upon bringin up a lift it'll show when I last did that lift and what
my numbers for. I lift at Boss Barbell club under Dan Green and Dan's
numbers are usually just 2-3% over the last week. Having the last
numbers easily accessilble is a no brainer

## TODO
* Basic functionality so I can just dogfood the stupid thing
* Pay Uncle Steve $100 so I can put this on my phone
* Backup to Evernote or somewhere so I'm not locked into my parse
backend
* Figure out how to use parse properly and not my current shit show
code
* Try to work on this every day to some extent as part of my 100 days
  of git
* Maybe figure out a local storage / sync solution if I can't get a
  connection to save with.
* Figure out PickerIOS Item
Seriously, what the fuck is going on here, in theory it should work
like a select box, but that's not the case at all. Seems like I almost
have to create a corresponding input and position everything by hand.
Can't believe this isn't on google. Maybe I'm doing something simple wrong.
